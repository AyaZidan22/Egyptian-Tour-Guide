It was found in a damaged state, with the legs detached from the body.\n\nSignificance: The statue is significant not only for its artistic and historical value but also for the insights it provides into the funerary practices and beliefs of ancient Egypt.

          "Tutankhamun was born during ancient Egypt’s 18th Dynasty, In the years before Tut rose to the throne, Egypt was going through a period of great upheaval. King Amenhotep IV, who is believed to be Tut’s father, had turned away from his culture’s many gods to worship a sun god called the Aten. In honor of the new deity, he changed his own name to Akhenaten and named his son Tutankhaten, meaning “living image of Aten.”, But King Akhenaten died after about 17 years on the throne—and nine-year-old Tut ascended to power. The boy king restored the old ways of the kingdom, bringing back its many gods and opening new temples.\n\nTut also changed his name to Tutankhamun, which meant the “living image of Amun,” the Egyptian god of the air. He also took on the throne name,Nebkheperure, which was a nod to the old sun god Re. He married a woman named Ankhesenamun, a daughter of Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti. While the couple are not thought to have left any surviving children, two mummified fetuses found in Tut’s tomb were likely their stillborn daughters.\n\nKing Tut’s death:\n\nOne of the puzzles that has most vexed historians and scientists alike is how Tut died.\n\nTheories have abounded ever since British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered Tut’s tomb in 1922. Some suspect that he was murdered or died from malaria or another devastating disease. Others have hypothesized that Tut’s chest—which is missing ribs and a sternum—might have been crushed in an accident or fall from his chariot. Still others argue that he likely died an invalid, pointing to evidence of a clubfoot and canes that he may have used to walk One thing scholars do know is that Tut was young when he died—still a teenager by most accounts—and his death was unexpected.",
