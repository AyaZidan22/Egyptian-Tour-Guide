          """Hoda Shaarawi Street, formerly known as Qasr El-Aini Street, is an important street located in downtown Cairo, Egypt. It housed the headquarters of the Wafd Party, a major nationalist political party, as well as the offices of several Egyptian newspaper publications. It is named after the renowned Egyptian feminist and activist Hoda Shaarawi.
\nSome key facts about Hoda Shaarawi:
\nNour Al-Huda Mohamed Sultan Shaarawi (Arabic: نور الهدى محمد سلطان شعراوي ) was born in the Upper Egyptian city of Minya to the famous Egyptian Shaarawi family. She was the daughter of Muhamed Sultan Pasha Shaarawi, who later became president of Egypt's Chamber of Deputies. Her mother, Iqbal Hanim, was of Circassian descent and was sent from the Caucasus region to live with her uncle in Egypt.
Sha'arawi was educated at an early age along with her brothers, studying various subjects such as grammar and calligraphy in multiple languages. She spent her childhood and early adulthood secluded in an upper-class Egyptian community. After her father's death, she was under the guardianship of her eldest cousin, Ali Shaarawi. At the age of thirteen, she was married to her cousin Ali Sha'arawi, who Sultan named as the legal guardian of his children and trustee of his estate.
Hoda Shaarawi began her activism in her early 20s when she participated in the public efforts to resist the yellow fever epidemic that swept the country. In 1907, she called for collecting donations to establish the "Child Welfare Society", and the people enthusiastically supported her, but the government halted the project.
At the time, women in Egypt were confined to the house or harem which she viewed as a very backward system. Hoda Sha'arawi resented such restrictions on women's movements, and consequently started organizing lectures for women on topics of interest to them. This brought many women out of their homes and into public places for the first time, and Hoda Sha'arawi was able to convince them to help her establish a women's welfare society to raise money for the poor women of Egypt. In 1910, Hoda Sha'arawi opened a school for girls where she focused on teaching academic subjects rather than practical skills.
During the 1919 revolution, led Egypt's first ever women's protest marches. founded the egyptian feminist union 1923. Organized the forst women's conference in defense of palestine 1938.
She showed a clear interest in journalism and established the French-language magazine "Al-Masreyya" in 1925, with Ceza Nabarawi as its editor-in-chief. She later published it in Arabic. This magazine was interested in the Palestinian cause and the rights of the Palestinian people.
She died on December 12, 1947 due to a heart attack while writing a statement on her sickbed, in which she called on the Arab states to stand united in the Palestinian cause. """,
